        <h4>Article Heading</h4>
        <p>Tiemoue Bakayoko is a Chelsea player having today completed a transfer from Monaco.

Bakayoko, 22, is a tall, strong and quick central midfielder who was instrumental in Monaco’s Ligue 1 triumph last season, as well as their impressive run to the Champions League semi-finals.

He recently made his debut for France in the same line-up as new team-mate N’Golo Kante, and is widely recognised as one of the best young central midfielders in European football.

Bakayoko, who has signed a five-year contract and will wear the No.14 shirt, said: ‘I am very happy to be here and to join this great team. I have grown up watching Chelsea. Signing was the natural thing for me because it is a club I loved very much in my childhood.

‘I am now looking forward to evolving under this fantastic coach and alongside so many great team-mates.’</p>
