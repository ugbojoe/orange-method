# Then convert the words to numbers and symbols (use Command-D for multi-select)
# For example, the first line below should be changed to: 1 + 1 = 2
# Hint: use multi-select
1 + 1 = 2
1 + 2 = 3
1 + 3 = 4
2 + 3 = 5
4 + 1 = 5
4 - 2 = 2
4 - 3 = 1
5 - 3 = 2
six - 4 = 2
2 multiply 2 = 4
2 multiply 3 = six
3 multiply 2 = six
4 divided by 2 = 2
six divided by 2 = 3
six divided by 3 = 2
